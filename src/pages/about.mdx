_**A dreamer, a daydreamer who is practically living life, a bit out of reality**_.

![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5616AQGFmUakJEGpxA/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1613500636229?e=1682553600&v=beta&t=L3eSek5iYTbxWJJXkTq10a9aEfyI2rcl0xIhM_yXmJ8)

> Born in 1996. Raised in Chittagong and currently living in Dhaka, the two most beautiful and developed cities of Bangladesh.

In 2020, I have completed my bachelor’s degree in CSE from North South University. Moreover, I am a software engineer proficient in Python, React, pandas, numpy, Bootstrap, node js, Django framework and Web designing.

I’m still learning and I believe this will help me to bring the best version of me. So, what are my hobbies? Well, I enjoy taking photos. I am more enthusiastic about taking pictures of nature, people, still life and moments with which I can connect eternally.
